About the Game
--------------

The game is ready to play when two players are initialized with a board each and 5 ships placed.

By default, Player1 goes first. After each shot it will switch turns until there is a winner. 

A game_setup.rb file has been added which sets up the game to a ready state placing each ship from columns A through to E vertically.
